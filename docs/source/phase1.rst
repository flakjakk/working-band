Setting up the stage - fast
===========================

There is no substitute for a well set up stage, and laying your stage out properly is one of the most important aspects of the live show. It's no good setting your gear up all over the stage haphazardly - there has to be a plan, and a base design that creates an aesthetically pleasing view of the stage while allowing you to move around without hindrance.

Usually the band will set up in a specific way - everybody in 'their' spot. There should be a focal point for the setup - at the back of the stage this is usually the drum kit which should be set up centre-stage, while at the front it is the lead singer who must get the attention. Typically the guitarists would place their amps on either side of the kit.


Things to keep in mind:
-----------------------

#. Everyone on stage should be able to move anywhere on the stage
	- Guitar leads must allow free movements across the whole stage at all times
	- No mike-stands blocking movement across stage
	- No effect pedals in the way
	- No cables strung across the floor. Run them around to the back!
#. Mind the guitar necks! Never set up in such a way that the guitarists are constantly sword-fighting.
#. Stage monitors must be kept out of the way of the players. This shouldn't be an issue if you keep them in a line across stage-front.

Here is a representation of our basic layout:

Best Practise
=============

What stage?
-----------

In the case of a venue that lacks a proper stage area, where the band is going to be placed is often the last thing on the club owner / manager's mind. This means you might find yourself in an unsatisfactory situation - pre-empt this as much as possible by visiting the venue and finding the best possible place to play.

You do need to know how much floor area you require for a minimal setup [when you're all on stage and nobody is being side-swiped by the person next to them]. Discuss the options with the manager / owner. Given a logical argument they will usually agree with your requests.


For a quick setup you have to make sure that everyone has clear access to their part of the stage. This means that:


.. note::

	Keep the stage as clear as possible at all times. Once you've set an item up, move everything you don't need off the stage.


Drums first
-----------

Get all the kit gear onto the stage, as close as possible to the drummer's space - the rostrum if you're lucky enough to have one. This may take up space required by the guitarist/s at first.

PA second
---------

Place the speakers up front and the mixing desk on stage, as close to the operator as possible. Run all the required cables and plug in. At this time the guitarists should be running power cables from the outlets to where their amp and effects are to be situated. The floor monitors should be placed and power cables set up for them.

Guitar amps third
-----------------

Once the drummer's gear is out of the way the guitarists move their amps onto the stage and start plugging in their amps and wiring up their effects. Once complete they can start setting up their mike stands and running cables to the mixer. The drummer should also be wiring up his mikes at this time.


.. note::

	The drummer should be able to hear the bass at all times!

	
Monitors and mikes last
-----------------------

Plug in the power to the monitors and run audio cabling to the desk. At this point you should be ready for line checks.
