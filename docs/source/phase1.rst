Setting up the stage - fast
===========================

There is no substitute for a well set up stage, and laying your stage out properly is one of the most important aspects of the live show. It's no good setting your gear up all over the stage haphazardly - there has to be a plan, and a base design that creates an aesthetically pleasing view of the stage while allowing you to move around without hindrance.

Usually the band will set up in a specific way - everybody in 'their' spot. There should be a focal point for the setup - at the back of the stage this is usually the drum kit which should be set up centre-stage, while at the front it is the lead singer who must get the attention. Typically the guitarists would place their amps on either side of the kit.


Things to keep in mind:
-----------------------

#. Everyone on stage should be able to move anywhere on the stage
	- Guitar leads must allow free movements across the whole stage at all times
	- No mike-stands blocking movement across stage
	- No effect pedals in the way
	- No cables strung across the floor. Run them around to the back!
#. Mind the guitar necks! Never set up in such a way that the guitarists are constantly sword-fighting.
#. Stage monitors must be kept out of the way of the players. This shouldn't be an issue if you keep them in a line across stage-front.
