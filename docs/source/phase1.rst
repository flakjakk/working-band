Setting up the stage - fast
===========================

There is no substitute for a well set up stage, and laying your stage out properly is one of the most important aspects of the live show. It's no good setting your gear up all over the stage haphazardly - there has to be a plan, and a base design that creates an aesthetically pleasing view of the stage while allowing you to move around without hindrance.

Usually the band will set up in a specific way - everybody in 'their' spot. There should be a focal point for the setup - at the back of the stage this is usually the drum kit which should be set up centre-stage, while at the front it is the lead singer who must get the attention. Typically the guitarists would place their amps on either side of the kit.


Things to keep in mind:
-----------------------

#. Everyone on stage should be able to move anywhere on the stage
	- Guitar leads must allow free movements across the whole stage at all times
	- No mike-stands blocking movement across stage
	- No effect pedals in the way
	- No cables strung across the floor. Run them around to the back!
#. Mind the guitar necks! Never set up in such a way that the guitarists are constantly sword-fighting.
#. Stage monitors must be kept out of the way of the players. This shouldn't be an issue if you keep them in a line across stage-front.

Cabling
^^^^^^^

Make sure you have enough power and audio cables for everything, then add at least two spare power , speaker and audio cables

There are many different ways of cabling a stage but adhering to certain rules when supplying power to amps and routing sound-signal cables from amps and mikes to the mixing desk will make this a simple task.

In most small-stage environments the signals generated by the various cables should not interfere with each other too much, but in some environments routing cables correctly can improve sound problems dramatically. This is especially true when you are using a single-phase power supply to drive your sound equipment as well as lighting.

Lighting can cause real problems with your PA sound if you are powering your light rig from the same source as your sound equipment. Where possible you should find out if the venue has more than one power phase available. Most actually have a three-phase system and you should make sure that you separate the power for lighting from the power for the sound system and backline. This obviously requires adequate cabling.

	Where possible find ways to distinguish between cable types - a guitar cable has braided insulation around a plastic-coated core while speaker cables are made up of two wires - no braid. Open one of the jack covers if you are not sure. Using a speaker cable as a guitar lead will work, but your tone will definitely be way off.
