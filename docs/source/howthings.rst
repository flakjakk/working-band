Bass sound: big but not overpowering. Should work with the kick drum sound.

Channel settings on the mixer should not change much from gig to gig. If they need to be then you **are** doing something very wrong.
Use the same channels for each mike and instrument every time you play.
Label the channels clearly - some masking tape and a Sharpie work wonders when applied correctly!
