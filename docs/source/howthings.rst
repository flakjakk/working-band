How things should be
====================

Bass sound: big but not overpowering. Should work with the kick drum sound.

Use the same channels for each mike and instrument every time you play.
Label the channels clearly - some masking tape and a Sharpie work wonders when applied correctly!

Terminology
-----------
FOH:           Front-of-house - this typically refers to the sound as heard in front of the speakers, anywhere in the room.
