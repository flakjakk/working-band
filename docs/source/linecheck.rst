Process for the Line Check
==========================

.. note::   The one thing you don't want is to blow something before you start the check. Please follow the guidelines listed below to ensure safe operation of your system.

PA
^^

#. Make sure all power amp and / or PA speakers volumes are off
#. Make sure that the powered monitors are off and volumes turned off
#. The mixer
	- Check that all the faders on the desk are at the bottom [off] {#}_. Mute all the channels if possible
	- Check that your Aux output volumes are off - they feed the monitors and you don't want any signal going there yet!
	- Turn the mixer on
#. If all the right lights are blinking on the desk
	- Turn on the power amps or the PA speakers
	- Turn on the floor monitors
#. Check that everything is up and running
#. Turn the power amps / PA speakers and monitor volumes up to full
#. Push the main L/R faders up to '0' [some call this 'parity']

Vox
^^^

Starting with the lead vox channel turn the Gain off and push the fader up to '0'. If the volume is too low then ease the channel Gain up until it sounds loud enough. No higher. EQ to taste.

Turn the Aux [monitor] output volume on the mixer up to about 65%, then turn up the Aux pot on the channel until the vocal is clear in the monitors. It should not normally be louder than the front-of-house volume.

Follow suit with the rest of the vox mikes, being careful to maintain a balance between the lead and backing vox levels. Getting everyone to sing together would help!


Drums
^^^^^
.. [this be should link to 'Mikes for drum kits' doc].

Drummer to tap the mikes gently one by one - check that each one is sending a signal to the desk. When you're satisfied that all is connected check each mike for sound per the process for vox mikes. EQ as required then move on to the guitars.

Bass
^^^^
Bass player to fire up effects then his / her amp. Check for sound and EQ to taste. Check that any lines to the mixer are working and EQ to taste.

Guitar/s
^^^^^^^^

Guitarist/s to power on effects then amp/s. Check that they have sound and EQ to taste. Check that any lines to the mixer are working and EQ to taste.

If everything has worked up to this point then you are ready for Phase III which is the actual Sound Check.

------------------------------

.. [#] This would be an initial setup methodology. Subsequent setups at other gigs would entail that you ensure that only the main fader is off, not those for *all* the channels.
