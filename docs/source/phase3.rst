The Sound Check
===============

Okay, so we've finally reached the place where:

	- everything is in it's place on stage
	- all the lights are on
	- all instruments and vocals and kit mikes are coming through the system
	- all the vocals are present in the monitors
	- all bags, cases, boxes etc. have been cleared off stage and we can move around without falling all over the place

It's time for the sound check.



Kit
---
.. note::

	If playing in a corner [as often happens] and the kit sound is bouncing around [messy], try to pad the area around the kit with speaker covers, guitar cases etc. This can make a huge difference to the overall stage sound.
