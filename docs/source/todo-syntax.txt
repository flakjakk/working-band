Headings
========

* with overline, for parts
# with overline, for chapters
=, for sections
-, for subsections
^, for subsubsections
“, for paragraphs

Lists
=====
* This is a bulleted list.
* It has two items, the second
  item uses two lines. (note the indentation)

1. This is a numbered list.
2. It has two items too.

#. This is a numbered list.
#. It has two items too.

use one asterisk on each side of a text you want to emphasize in italic and 2 asterisks in you want to make it bold:

*italic*
**bold**

.. This text will not be shown 
   (but, for instance, in HTML might be 
   rendered as an HTML comment)

Images
======
.. image:: stars.jpg
    :width: 200px
    :align: center
    :height: 100px
    :alt: alternate text

.. image:: ../images/wiki_logo_openalea.png
    :width: 200px
    :align: center
    :height: 100px
    :alt: alternate text

Figure directive
================

.. figure:: ../images/wiki_logo_openalea.png
    :width: 200px
    :align: center
    :height: 100px
    :alt: alternate text
    :figclass: align-center

figures are like images but with a caption

    and whatever else you wish to add

    .. code-block:: python

        import image

Boxes
=====
seealso:
.. seealso:: This is a simple **seealso** note.

note:
.. note::  This is a **note** box.

Comments:
=========
comments can be made by adding two dots at the beginning of a line as follows:

.. comments

Simple table:	
=============
Simple tables can be written as follows:

+---------+---------+-----------+
| 1       |  2      |  3        |
+---------+---------+-----------+

Complex table:
==============

+------------+------------+-----------+
| Header 1   | Header 2   | Header 3  |
+============+============+===========+
| body row 1 | column 2   | column 3  |
+------------+------------+-----------+
| body row 2 | Cells may span columns.|
+------------+------------+-----------+
| body row 3 | Cells may  | - Cells   |
+------------+ span rows. | - contain |
| body row 4 |            | - blocks. |
+------------+------------+-----------+

Another way:
============

=====  =====  ======
   Inputs     Output
------------  ------
  A      B    A or B
=====  =====  ======
False  False  False
True   False  True
=====  =====  ======

Internal hyperlinks:
====================
 	
All titles are considered as internal hyperlinks that may be referred to using this syntax:

`Internal and External links`_

You may also create hyperlink as follows:

.. _begin:
And then inserting begin_ in your text. For instance, jump to the beginning of this document rst_tutorial

Note the underscore at the end of the links

External links:
===============
In order to link to external links simply use:

`Python <http://www.python.org/>`_
that is rendered as a normal hyperlink Python.

Note

If you have an underscore within the label/name, you got to escape it with a ‘\’ character.

Include other reST files and TOC
================================
Since reST does not have facilities to interconnect several documents, or split documents into multiple output files, Sphinx uses a custom directive to add relations between the single files the documentation is made of, as well as tables of contents. The toctree directive is the central element.

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2

    intro
    chapter1
    chapter2
Globbing can be used by adding the glob option:

.. toctree::
    :glob:

    intro*
    recipe/*
    *
The name of the file is used to create the title in the TOC. You may want to change this behaviour by changing the toctree as follows:

.. toctree::
    :glob:

    intro
    Chapter1 description <chapter1>
	
Comments:
=========
comments can be made by adding two dots at the beginning of a line as follows:

.. comments

Aliases:	
========
The first method is to add at end of your reST document something like:

.. _Python: http://www.python.org/
Then, write your text inserting the keywrod Python_ . The final result will be as follows: Python .

A second method is as follows:

.. |longtext| replace:: this is a very very long text to include
and then insert |longtext| wherever needed.

Note
====

Note that when you define the reference or alias, the underscore is before the keyword. However, when you refer to it, the underscore is at the end. The underscore after the keyword is also used for internal references, citations, aliases ...

Footnotes
=========
Some text that requires a footnote [#f1]_ .

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f1] Text of the first footnote.
