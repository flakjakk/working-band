Stage setup

Setting up the stage - fast
###########################

There is no substitute for a well set up stage, and laying your stage out properly is one of the most important aspects of playing live. It's no good setting your gear up all over the stage haphazardly - there has to be a plan, and a base design that creates an aesthetically pleasing view of your gear and allows you to move around without hindrance.

Usually the band will set up in a specific way - everybody in 'their' spot. There should be a focal point for the setup - this is usually the drum kit which should be set up centre-stage. Typically the guitarists would place their amps on either side of the kit.

.. note::

	The drummer should be able to hear the bass at all times!



Things to keep in mind:

#. Everyone on stage should be able to move anywhere on the stage
	#. Guitar leads must allow free movements across the whole stage at all times
	#. No mike-stands blocking movement across stage
#. etc
