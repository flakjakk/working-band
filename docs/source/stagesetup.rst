Stage setup

Setting up the stage - fast
###########################

There is no substitute for a well set up stage, and laying your stage out properly is one of the most important aspects of playing live. It's no good setting your gear up all over the stage haphazardly - there has to be a plan, and a base design that creates an aesthetically pleasing view of your gear and allows you to move around without hindrance.

Usually the band will set up in a specific way - everybody in 'their' spot.

This requires you to keep a number of points in mind:

1. Everyone on stage must have access to everyone else on stage
2.Your guitar leads must allow free movements across the whole stage at all times
etc.
