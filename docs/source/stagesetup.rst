Stage setup

Setting up the stage - fast
###########################

There is no substitute for a well set up stage, and laying your stage out properly is one of the most important aspects of playing live. It's no good setting your gear up all over the stage haphazardly - there has to be a plan, and a base design that creates an aesthetically pleasing view of your gear and allows you to move around without hindrance.

Usually the band will set up in a specific way - everybody in 'their' spot. There should be a focal point for the setup - this is usually the drum kit which should be set up centre-stage. Typically the guitarists would place their amps on either side of the kit.

.. note::

	The drummer should be able to hear the bass at all times!


Things to keep in mind:
=======================

#. Everyone on stage should be able to move anywhere on the stage
	#. Guitar leads must allow free movements across the whole stage at all times
	#. No mike-stands blocking movement across stage
#. Mind the guitar necks! Never set up in such a way that the guitarists are constantly sword-fighting.
#. Stage monitors must be kept out of the way of the players. This shouldn't be an issue if you keep them in a line across stage-front.

Best Practise
#############

For a quick setup you have to make sure that everyone has clear access to their part of the stage. This means that:

Drums first
===========

Get all the kit gear onto the stage, as close as possible to the drummer's space - the rostrum if you're lucky enough to have one. This may take up space required by the guitarist/s at first.

PA second
=========

Place the speakers up front and the mixing desk on stage, as close to the operator as possible. Run all the require cables and plug in. At this time the guitarists should be running power cables from the outlets. Power to the stage monitors should also be run now.

Guitar amps third
=================

Once the drummer's gear is out of the way the guitarists move their amps onto the stage and start plugging in their amps and wiring up their effects. Once complete they can start setting up their mike stands and running cables to the mixer.

.. note::

	Keep the stage as clear as possivble at all times. Once you've set an item up, move everything you don't need off the stage.

Monitors and mikes
==================

Plug in the power to the monitors and run audio cabling to the desk. At this point you should be ready for line checks.
