Introduction to the Manual
==========================

This effort is a collation of the knowledge I have gathered during my 30+ years in the music industry. I'm still gathering knowledge and experience, and will therefore be continually adding content.

For me, playing live is where it's at. I believe there is little value in learning to sing or play an instrument if you are not going to use what you have learned in a meaningful way.

For those readers who feel the same way this site will present insights into the ups and downs of playing live. There are many pitfalls out there, some internal, and others external - my intention is to provide relevant information that will help you on your way to becoming an accomplished performer, not in the comfort of your own lounge / garage but in front of a critical audience.

Be warned, I am presenting my opinion based on my own experiences here, your's may be vastly different, but I'd like to know if you have a different point of view or approach to any of the issues discussed on the site. Please email me at edkidgell@gmail.com, your input will be much appreciated.
