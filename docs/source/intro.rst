Introduction to the Manual
==========================

This effort is a collation of the knowledge I have gathered during my 30+ years in the music industry. As I'm still gathering knowledge and experience the content in this manual will be constantly updated / added to :-]

For me, playing live is where it's at and for those readers who feel the same way this manual presents insights into the ups and downs of playing live. There are many pitfalls out there, some internal, and others external - my intention is to provide relevant information that will help you on your way to becoming a better live performer.

Please bear in mind that I am presenting my opinion based on my own experiences here, your's may be very different, so I invite feedback if you have a different point of view or approach to any of the issues discussed.

Who this manual is for
----------------------

The information supplied here is applicable to anyone who sets up their own gear and performs music in front of an audience. It applies to any venue, from churches to restaurants to clubs.

I trust you will find it useful.
