Process for the Line Check
==========================

.. note::

The one thing you don't want is to blow something before you start the check. Please follow the guidelines listed below to ensure safe operation of your system.

PA
^^

#. Make sure all power amp and / or PA speakers volumes are off, ditto for the powered monitors.
	- Check that the faders on the desk are all at the bottom [off]. Mute all the channels if possible
	- Turn the mixer on
#. If all the right lights are blinking on the desk
	- Turn on the power amps or the PA speakers
	- Turn on the floor monitors
#. Check that everything is up and running
#. Turn the power amps / PA speaker volumes up to full. Ditto for the monitors
#. Push the main L/R faders up to '0' [some call this 'parity']
#. 

Drums
^^^^^

Once the drummer is happy with the kit layout he must




Now you are ready for Phase III which is The Sound Check.
