Pre-requisites

Cabling
-------

Make sure you have enough power and audio cables for everything, then add at least two spare power, speaker and audio cables

There are many different ways of cabling a stage but adhering to certain rules when supplying power to amps and routing sound-signal cables from amps and mikes to the mixing desk will make this a simple task. Some things to keep in mind:

	- Try and avoid running power and audio cables together
	- Never run cables *across* the stage. Go around.

Keep spare power extensions handy. Sooner or later you'll have to bring power to the stage from somewhere in the depths of the kitchen / store-room / whatever. Be prepared for this.

In most small-stage environments the signals generated by the various cables should not interfere with each other too much, but in some environments routing cables correctly can improve sound problems dramatically. This is especially true when you are using a single-phase power supply to drive your sound equipment as well as lighting.

Lighting can cause real problems with your PA sound if you are powering your light rig from the same source as your sound equipment. Where possible you should find out if the venue has more than one power phase available. Most actually have a three-phase system and you should make sure that you separate the power for lighting from the power for the sound system and backline. This obviously requires adequate cabling.


Marking your cables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is a good idea to mark your cables clearly. Getting into a bun-fight over which cable belongs to whom is not worth the trouble. Use some electrical tape for this - it comes in different colours, so pick one and wrap it round the end of each of your own cables.

	Where possible find ways to distinguish between cable types - a guitar cable has braided insulation around a plastic-coated core while speaker cables are made up of two wires - no braid. Open one of the jack covers if you are not sure. Using a speaker cable as a guitar lead may work, but your tone will definitely be way off.


Kit
---

Drummer must bring with him a carpet large enough to place the entire drum kit on, but no bigger than that [unless you like the 'lounge' feel!]. This is critical when you're expected to play on a bare floor, and can be used as a basic template around which all your back-line gear can be arranged.
