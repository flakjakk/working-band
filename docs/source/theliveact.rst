Perfecting the live act
-----------------------

Practise
^^^^^^^^

	"Amateurs practise until they get it right, professionals practise until they can't get it wrong" - source Unknown

One of the critical elements for any band / group. If you don't practise together you will never be tight, and tight is right. Practise time can also be used for experimentation within the group - try new leads / harmonies / feels etc.

Tip: A metronome is an invaluable tool and you should always use it when practising. You can get these at any music shop - so do it !

More you can do . .
- Record often
- Video the band

Butterflies
^^^^^^^^^^^

This may seem a little odd to some, but many performers, myself included, even after many years of playing live, get nervous before going on stage. At first it hampered my performance significantly, but I later learned to use this nervous energy to my advantage.
