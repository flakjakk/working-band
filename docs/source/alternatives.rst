## Backing tracks


Many gigging musicians would prefer not to work with backing tracks.

Having said that, it is obvious that a band with less membersis more likely to earn more money per member. There is more scope for gigs:
* The band has a smaller stage footprint
* They can play in many venues that cannot accommodate bigger bands
* The logistics involved are simpler for a smaller band

All of the above contribute greatly to the band's value for money from the pub / club owner's point of view - *more bang for your buck*, so to speak.

> The question for many is: *"Do I compromise my artistry by pushing some buttons, or do I earn less money in an effort to maintain my musical integrity?"*.

So where to now? Or ...

## Sources for backing tracks

The best way to use tracks would be an mp3 player of some kind - an iPad with SoundCue installed is *very* handy for this, but there are other options. You can use a laptop just as well.

### The Internet

#### Buy Direct

#### Build your own

##### Using midi files to create your own tracks

If you have a sequencer setup at home - either hardware- or pc-based you can create your own midi files and use these as a basis for your backing tracks.
   2. Downloading the midi files from the net is a really fast way to pick up midi tracks, but just remember that the quality can be very suspect.

Now, once you have the midi file how do you convert it to a usable format on stage?

Playing the file on your pc will give you a really basic sound - Windows has a built-in Software Synth capable of playing midi files, but the sound quality irritates rather than elevates. You want the songs to sound big, and fat. Like the cd.

*How to make your tracks you achieve this?*

##### Using a sound card

You can purchase a dedicated sound card for your pc - works just like your graphics card in that you use the inputs /  outputs on the card instead of the ones supplied with your pc. There are a number of good quality cards out there and you may have to shop around a bit before finding one that suits both your pocket and your ears.

If you adopt this method and are happy with the results you can jump to section [x] where we discuss recording the output.

##### Using a midi in / out connection to an external sound module

If you have a hardware sound module available - this can be any midi-capable keyboard or actual sound source - you can purchase a usb-midi connector to connect your pc to the sound source. These retail at around R300.00 in SA. Finding one may be a problem but if you talk to Music Connection they can set you right.

Follow the instructions for the sound module and connector and if you're happy with the results go to section [x] - recording the output.

##### Using a third-party program to play / edit the midi file

You can always go out and blow soem cash on something like CuBase, but this is a fully fledged recording studio application with all the bells and whistles - unnecessary expense in this situation. My personal preference is an app called REAPER - I use it for all playing / recording / editing of files to be used for backing tracks. It can run on a reasonably low spec machine and you don't need to outlay any cash in order to achieve great sound. It plays the midi files, and once the file is split into it's component channels you can edit them individually, add effects, add / change instruments etc. to your hearts content.

Sounds can be downloaded from the net [free or purchased] and once you are happy with them you can record the tracks as a single mp3 / wav or whatever format you prefer. Brilliant.

REAPER is not free and you are expected to pay for a license if you are going to use it commercially, so Do The Right Thing and buy the license. It's worth every cent bru. However, REAPER retains full functionality indefinitely without being licensed. Odd but true.
