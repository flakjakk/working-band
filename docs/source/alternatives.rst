## Backing tracks

For the gigging rock 'n roller the thought of using backing tracks is anathema.

Having said that, it is a fact that the less members a gigging band has, the more likely it is the individual members will earn more. They get more gigs and they earn more bucks per gig than bigger, all-muso bands. True.

So, where does that leave your average muso, who wants to play music but also wants to make more money? He / she has to make a choice, asking him- / herself the following question,"Do I compromise myself by learning to push buttons, or do I earn less money in an effort to maintain my credibility?". I think most of you know the answer to that one.

Besides, the average one- to three-piece outfit is a lot easier to move around. Having to haul less gear, and having a smaller stage-footprint makes it easier to fit into smaller venues. You can deliver very good value-for-money [given that you have some clue as to how to deliver a good live performance] so club / pub owners will be more willing to give you a trial-run than say, a 5-piece rock outfit who build a wall of Marshall stacks behind them on stage before plugging in.

## So where to now?

You've decided you're now ok with the thought of using backing tracks; but where would you get them?

If you ask around at music shops you will probably find a contact who can provide these. The quality might be an issue, but in SA you can get them for around R120.00 per song. However, there are other options open to you.

### Using midi files to create your own tracks

   1. If you have a sequencer setup at home - either hardware- or pc-based you can create your own midi files and use these as a basis for your backing tracks.
   2. Downloading the midi files from the net is a really fast way to pick up midi tracks, but just remember that the quality can be very suspect.

Now, once you have the midi file how do you convert it to a usable format on stage?

Playing the file on your pc will give you a really basic sound - Windows has a built-in Software Synth capable of playing midi files, but the sound quality irritates rather than elevates. You want the songs to sound big, and fat. Like the cd.

### How to make your tracks you achieve this?

#### Using a sound card

You can purchase a dedicated sound card for your pc - works just like your graphics card in that you use the inputs /  outputs on the card instead of the ones supplied with your pc. There are a number of good quality cards out there and you may have to shop around a bit before finding one that suits both your pocket and your ears.

If you adopt this method and are happy with the results you can jump to section [x] where we discuss recording the output.

#### Using a midi in / out connection to an external sound module.

If you have a hardware sound module available - this can be any midi-capable keyboard or actual sound source - you can purchase a usb-midi connector to connect your pc to the sound source. These retail at around R300.00 in SA. Finding one may be a problem but if you talk to Music Connection they can set you right.

Follow the instructions for the sound module and connector and if you're happy with the results go to section [x] - recording the output.

#### Using a third-party program to play / edit the midi file

You can always go out and blow soem cash on something like CuBase, but this is a fully fledged recording studio application with all the bells and whistles - unnecessary expense in this situation. My personal preference is an app called REAPER - I use it for all playing / recording / editing of files to be used for backing tracks. It can run on a reasonably low spec machine and you don't need to outlay any cash in order to achieve great sound. It plays the midi files, and once the file is split into it's component channels you can edit them individually, add effects, add / change instruments etc. to your hearts content.

Sounds can be downloaded from the net [free or purchased] and once you are happy with them you can record the tracks as a single mp3 / wav or whatever format you prefer. Brilliant.

REAPER is not free and you are expected to pay for a license if you are going to use it commercially, so Do The Right Thing and buy the license. It's worth every cent bru. However, REAPER retains full functionality indefinitely without being licensed. Odd but true.
